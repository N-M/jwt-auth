Installation
============

The recommended way to install JWT-Auth is with composer
`Composer <https://getcomposer.org>`_. Composer is a dependency management tool
for PHP that allows you to declare the dependencies your project needs and
installs them into your project.

You can add JWT-Auth as a dependency using Composer:

.. code-block:: bash

  composer require jimtools/jwt-auth

.. note::

  If using Apache add the following to the ``.htaccess`` file. Otherwise, PHP won't
  have access to the ``Authorization`` header.

.. code-block::

  RewriteRule .* - [env=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%{HTTP:Authorization}]

=========

The git repository contains an `upgrade guide`__ that details what changed
