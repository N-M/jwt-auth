======================
Quickstart
======================

This page provides a quick introduction to JWT-Auth and introductory examples.
If you have not already installed, JWT-Auth, head over to the
:ref:`installation` page.

This quickstart will use Slim framework as am example but this will work with
any PSR-15 compliant framework.

Basic Useage
============

The below example is the most basic use of the middleware, acting as a global
authentication middleware on all routes. by default it will expect a JWT in the
``Authentication`` header or cookie  named ``token`` prefixed with **Bearer**
followed by the token i.e. ``Bearer xx.yy.zz``


.. code-block:: php

  use Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface as Response;
  use Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface as Request;
  use Slim\Factory\AppFactory;
  use JimTools\JwtAuth\Middleware\JwtAuthentication;
  use JimTools\JwtAuth\Options;

  require __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php';

  $app = AppFactory::create();
  $app->addRoutingMiddleware();
  $errorMiddleware = $app->addErrorMiddleware(true, true, true);

  // Register Authentication Middleware
  $authentication = new JwtAuthentication(new Options(), new FirebaseDecoder());
  $app->addMiddleware($authentication);

  $app->get('/hello/{name}', function (Request $request, Response $response, $args) {
      $name = $args['name'];
      $response->getBody()->write("Hello, $name");
      return $response;
  });

  $app->run();

Custom Rules
============

You may not always want a global authentication on all routes this is where
custom rules comes in, the third parameter of ``JwtAuthentication`` allow you to
specify which routes to authentication. the third argumet should be an array of
``JimTools\JwtAuth\Rules\RuleInterface``

.. code-block:: php

  use JimTools\JwtAuth\Rules\RequestMethodRule;
  use JimTools\JwtAuth\Rules\RequestPathRule;

  $rules = [
    new RequestMethodRule(ignore: ['OPTIONS']),
    new RequestPathRule(paths: ['/'], ignore: ['/auth/login'])
  ]

  // Register Authentication Middleware
  $authentication = new JwtAuthentication(new Options(), new FirebaseDecoder(), $rules);
  $app->addMiddleware($authentication);


Out of the box there are two rules provided ``RequestMethodRule`` and
``RequestPathRule``, these should cover 90% of all use cases but if you need
fine-grained control you can while your own custom rules which impliments
the ``RuleInterface`` interface.

RequestMethodRule
-----------------

This rule allows you bypass all request with a specific HTTP method, by default
it will ignore ``OPTION``, check out
`MDN Http Request Methods <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods>`_
for more infomation on methods.

RequestPathRule
---------------

This rule determines which url paths the authentication will action on, it takes
two parameter both expect an array of strings.

paths is a list or URI where the authentication will take act on, this can be a
string literal or a regular expression for example.

.. code-block:: php

  new RequestPathRule(['/privte', '/users/\d+'])

ignore is a list or URI where authentication will be bypassed, this can by a
string literal or a regular expression for example.

.. code-block:: php

  new RequestPathRule(['/'], ['/auth/login', '/products/[a-zA-Z0-9_-]]'])

.. note::
  All regular expressions are **not** treated as case insensative.
